## 1. Conversation Persistence

### User Story
As a user, I want my conversations to be saved automatically so that I can access them later without losing my chat history.

### 1.1 Conversation Creation and Persistence

**AC-1.1.1: Auto-save New Conversation**
- **Given** a user starts typing in an empty chat
- **When** they send their first message
- **Then** the conversation should be automatically created in MongoDB with:
  - Unique conversation ID (UUID)
  - Auto-generated title from first 50 characters of first user message
  - Status set to `WAITING_FOR_RESPONSE`
  - `createdAt` timestamp
  - `updatedAt` timestamp
  - Empty messages array (user message saved separately)

**AC-1.1.2: Conversation ID Generation**
- **Given** a new conversation is being created
- **When** the conversation entity is instantiated
- **Then** a UUID v4 should be generated for the conversation ID
- **And** this ID should be returned to the frontend
- **And** this ID should be stored in browser's localStorage as `currentConversationId`

**AC-1.1.3: Title Auto-generation**
- **Given** a user sends the first message in a new conversation
- **When** the message content is "What is the weather like in San Francisco today?"
- **Then** the conversation title should be "What is the weather like in San Francisco today?"
- **And** when the message content exceeds 50 characters
- **Then** the title should be truncated with "..." (e.g., "What is the weather like in San Francisco tod...")
- **And** when the message has multiple lines
- **Then** only the first line should be used for the title

### 1.2 Message Persistence

**AC-1.2.1: User Message Saved**
- **Given** a user sends a message in an active conversation
- **When** the API receives the message
- **Then** the message should be persisted to MongoDB with:
  - Message ID
  - Role: `user`
  - Content (text)
  - Timestamp
  - Conversation ID reference
- **And** the conversation's `updatedAt` should be updated
- **And** the conversation status should be set to `WAITING_FOR_RESPONSE`

**AC-1.2.2: Assistant Message Saved**
- **Given** the AI generates a response
- **When** the streaming completes successfully
- **Then** the assistant message should be persisted with:
  - Message ID
  - Role: `assistant`
  - Full response content
  - Timestamp
  - Tool invocations (if any)
  - Conversation ID reference
- **And** the conversation status should be set to `ACTIVE`
- **And** the conversation's `updatedAt` should be updated

**AC-1.2.3: Tool Message Saved**
- **Given** a tool is invoked during a conversation
- **When** the tool execution completes
- **Then** the tool message should be persisted with:
  - Message ID
  - Role: `tool`
  - Tool name
  - Tool call ID
  - Tool result content
  - Timestamp
  - Conversation ID reference

**AC-1.2.4: Message Ordering Preserved**
- **Given** a conversation with multiple messages
- **When** messages are retrieved from the database
- **Then** they should be ordered by timestamp (ascending)
- **And** message sequence should match the order they were created

### 1.3 Conversation Updates

**AC-1.3.1: Incremental Message Addition**
- **Given** an existing conversation in MongoDB
- **When** a new message is added
- **Then** only the new message should be inserted
- **And** the conversation's `updatedAt` timestamp should be updated
- **And** no existing messages should be modified or duplicated

**AC-1.3.2: Status Transitions**
- **Given** a conversation with status `ACTIVE`
- **When** a user sends a message
- **Then** status should transition to `WAITING_FOR_RESPONSE`
- **And** when the assistant responds
- **Then** status should transition back to `ACTIVE`

**AC-1.3.3: Concurrent Update Handling**
- **Given** two browser tabs with the same conversation open
- **When** a user sends a message from tab 1
- **And** simultaneously sends another message from tab 2
- **Then** both messages should be persisted without data loss
- **And** the message order should be determined by server timestamp
- **And** no race condition errors should occur

**AC-7.3.1: Default Collapsed State**
- **Given** a user on desktop (1440px width)
- **When** they first visit the app
- **Then** the sidebar should be collapsed
- **And** the chat area should occupy full width
- **And** the hamburger menu should be visible

**AC-7.3.2: Expanded Sidebar Width**
- **Given** the sidebar is expanded on desktop
- **When** viewing the layout
- **Then** the sidebar should be 320px wide
- **And** the chat area should be (viewport width - 320px)
- **And** both areas should be fully functional

**AC-7.3.3: Sidebar State Persistence**
- **Given** a user expands the sidebar on desktop
- **When** they refresh the page
- **Then** the sidebar should remember its state (expanded/collapsed)
- **And** the state should be stored in localStorage as `sidebarOpen`

### 7.4 Ultra-wide Screens (≥1920px)

**AC-7.4.1: Maximum Chat Width**
- **Given** a user on a 4K monitor (3840px width)
- **When** viewing the chat
- **Then** the chat area should have a maximum width of 1200px
- **And** should be centered in the available space
- **And** should not stretch to full width

**AC-7.4.2: Sidebar Scaling**
- **Given** an ultra-wide screen
- **When** the sidebar is open
- **Then** the sidebar width should remain 320px (not scale)
- **And** font sizes should remain readable

## 8. Data Integrity

### User Story
As a user, I expect my conversation data to be reliable and never lost or corrupted.

### 8.1 No Message Loss

**AC-8.1.1: Message Persistence Guarantee**
- **Given** a user sends a message
- **When** the API confirms receipt (200 OK)
- **Then** the message must be persisted to MongoDB before the response is sent
- **And** if database write fails, the API should return 500 error
- **And** the frontend should retry the send

**AC-8.1.2: Streaming Interruption**
- **Given** the AI is streaming a response
- **When** the connection is interrupted mid-stream
- **Then** the partial response should be saved to the database
- **And** the conversation status should reflect the interruption
- **And** the user should be able to retry with "Regenerate" button

**AC-8.1.3: Browser Crash Recovery**
- **Given** a user sends a message
- **When** the browser crashes before the response completes
- **Then** on reopen, the conversation should be restored
- **And** the last user message should be visible
- **And** if the assistant response was interrupted, show "Response interrupted" state

### 8.2 No Duplicate Conversations

**AC-8.2.1: UUID Uniqueness**
- **Given** a new conversation is created
- **When** the UUID is generated
- **Then** it must be a valid UUID v4
- **And** must be unique in the database (checked via unique index)
- **And** if a collision occurs (astronomically rare), generate a new UUID

**AC-8.2.2: Concurrent Creation Prevention**
- **Given** two tabs both create a new conversation simultaneously
- **When** both try to save
- **Then** both should succeed with different UUIDs
- **And** no race condition should cause the same UUID to be used
- **And** both conversations should appear in the sidebar

**AC-8.2.3: Duplicate Detection**
- **Given** a conversation already exists with ID "abc-123"
- **When** a save operation is called for "abc-123"
- **Then** it should update the existing conversation (not create a duplicate)
- **And** the `updatedAt` timestamp should be modified
- **And** the `createdAt` timestamp should remain unchanged

### 8.3 Correct Message Ordering

**AC-8.3.1: Timestamp Accuracy**
- **Given** messages are added to a conversation
- **When** each message is saved
- **Then** the timestamp should be server-generated (not client-generated)
- **And** timestamps should use UTC
- **And** messages should be sortable by timestamp

**AC-8.3.2: Message Sequence Validation**
- **Given** a conversation follows domain rules (user → assistant → user)
- **When** messages are retrieved from the database
- **Then** they should be ordered chronologically
- **And** role alternation should be validated
- **And** invalid sequences should be flagged in logs

**AC-8.3.3: Tool Message Ordering**
- **Given** an assistant message invokes a tool
- **When** the tool result is received
- **Then** the tool message should be inserted immediately after the assistant message
- **And** should reference the correct `tool_call_id`
- **And** should not break message ordering

### 8.4 Transaction Integrity

**AC-8.4.1: Atomic Conversation + Message Creation**
- **Given** a new conversation with the first message
- **When** both are saved
- **Then** they should be saved in a single transaction
- **And** if message save fails, conversation should not be created
- **And** if conversation save fails, message should not be saved

**AC-8.4.2: Update Consistency**
- **Given** a conversation is being updated
- **When** the `updatedAt` timestamp is modified
- **Then** it must be updated atomically with the message insertion
- **And** no partial updates should occur
- **And** if any part fails, the entire update should rollback

**AC-8.4.3: Cascade Delete Integrity**
- **Given** a conversation is deleted
- **When** the delete operation executes
- **Then** all associated messages must also be deleted
- **And** the delete should be atomic (all or nothing)
- **And** no orphaned messages should remain in the database

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Accessibility

**AC-NFR-1: Keyboard Navigation**
- All sidebar interactions must be accessible via keyboard
- Tab order must be logical (hamburger → filter → conversation list → new chat)
- Delete confirmation must support Enter (confirm) and ESC (cancel)

**AC-NFR-2: Screen Reader Support**
- Conversation list must have proper ARIA labels
- Active conversation must be announced as "selected"
- Loading states must be announced to screen readers

**AC-NFR-3: Color Contrast**
- All text must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards (4.5:1 ratio)
- Status indicators must not rely solely on color (use icons too)

### Security

**AC-NFR-4: Data Sanitization**
- All user input must be sanitized before saving to MongoDB
- Conversation titles must be escaped to prevent XSS
- Message content must be validated for malicious scripts

**AC-NFR-5: MongoDB Connection Security**
- Connection string must use TLS/SSL
- Credentials must be stored in environment variables only
- No database credentials in client-side code

### Browser Compatibility

**AC-NFR-6: Supported Browsers**
- Chrome/Edge (last 2 versions)
- Firefox (last 2 versions)
- Safari (last 2 versions)
- Mobile Safari (iOS 14+)
- Chrome Mobile (Android 10+)

## Edge Cases

### EC-1: Very Long Conversation Titles
- **Given** a user's first message is 500 characters long
- **Then** the title should truncate to 50 characters + "..."
- **And** the full title should be visible in a tooltip on hover

### EC-2: Rapid Conversation Switching
- **Given** a user clicks 5 different conversations within 2 seconds
- **Then** only the last clicked conversation should load
- **And** previous pending requests should be cancelled
- **And** no race condition should occur

### EC-3: Empty Message Content
- **Given** a user sends a message with only whitespace
- **Then** the message should not be sent
- **And** an error should appear: "Message cannot be empty"

### EC-4: Conversation at Exact Limit
- **Given** a conversation has exactly 1,000 messages
- **When** the user tries to send message 1,001
- **Then** the domain error should be caught and displayed
- **And** the user should be prompted to start a new conversation

### EC-5: MongoDB Quota Exceeded
- **Given** MongoDB Atlas free tier reaches storage limit
- **When** trying to save a new conversation
- **Then** a clear error should appear: "Storage limit reached. Please upgrade your account."
- **And** existing conversations should remain accessible (read-only)

## Acceptance Testing Approach

### Manual Testing
- Fran will use Playwright MCP to validate all UI interactions
- Each acceptance criterion will have a corresponding Playwright test
- Tests will cover desktop (1920x1080), tablet (768x1024), and mobile (375x667)

### Automated Testing
- Backend: Vitest unit tests for all use cases and repository methods
- Frontend: React Testing Library for hooks and components
- Integration: Playwright E2E tests for critical user flows

### Test Environments
- **Local**: In-memory repository for fast iteration
- **Staging**: MongoDB Atlas test cluster
- **Production**: MongoDB Atlas production cluster (after validation)

## Open Questions for Implementation

1. **Pagination Strategy**: Should we implement infinite scroll or "Load More" button for 100+ conversations?
2. **Real-time Updates**: Should conversations update in real-time when changed in another tab/device (WebSocket)?
3. **Conversation Search**: Should we add full-text search in a future iteration?
4. **Conversation Export**: Should users be able to export conversations as PDF/JSON?

**Document Version**: 1.0
**Created By**: QA Criteria Validator Agent
**Review Status**: Awaiting Fran's Approval
